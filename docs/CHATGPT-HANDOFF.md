# ChatGPT handoff — Spotify Desk Thing

> Current-state save point, not the full project history. **Read this first** in a new project conversation. Cross-check against the current branch and commits.

Updated: 2026-10-20

## Repository / checkpoint

- Repository: `Cousinsuke/Spotify-Desk`
- Default / current development branch: `main` (no alternate development branch established yet)
- Last source baseline: **Phase 5.2** source imported into `main` from checksum-checked ZIP; actual GitHub commit verified
- Latest implementation checkpoint: **`7172c2ee2f285253507b13c71acb7072adc04067`** (`feat: import accepted Phase 5.2 desktop and simulator baseline`, source commit). Later docs/script commits are not a newer application version.
- Handoff status: GitHub migration verified complete. All 16 historical ZIP snapshots and the checksum manifest are committed at `f78150605b15af1fa451aa5ed725f023fd03835c`; this is an archive commit, not a newer application implementation checkpoint.
- GitHub access: connected read/write access was confirmed at bootstrap; verify access in future conversations

## Current project phase vs current actual work

- **Current project phase:** Phase 6 — hardware research, compatibility decisions and first firmware design (**planned, not implemented**)
- **Current actual work:** Phase 6 **electrical schematic/boot review** of provisional **Waveshare touchscreen SKU 25948 + Adafruit push encoder 377 + Waveshare AW9523B expansion SKU 22132**, with provisional KZ0087 knob. AW9523B silicon datasheet confirmed initial GPIO outputs, 0x58 address / default P0 open-drain LOW, 0x04 input configuration and **internal RESET pull-down**. Conditional 22k pull-up + 1k series-to-contact network devised for six inputs. **Full Waveshare module schematic unavailable to visually trace, so board reset pull-up, pin orientation and level shifter are not signed off**. No physical test or purchase.
- **Status:** Phase 5.2 software unchanged at `7172c2e`. Detailed electrical evidence and unresolved risks now recorded in **docs/HARDWARE-ELECTRICAL-REVIEW.md**; earlier mechanical measurements remain in **docs/HARDWARE-PRE-PURCHASE-CHECK.md**. Confirmed chip data: **GPIO reset as outputs**, with 0x58/AD0=AD1=0 **P0 low open-drain**; **RSTN internal 100k pulldown** needs external circuit. Example protected input network mathematically calculated only; no physical/board schematic approval. KZ0087 flat aluminium cap is provisional, not fitted. No purchased hardware.

## Last accepted work

- **Most recent validated repository task:** current Phase 5.2 source import and all 16 historical ZIP imports to GitHub; both commits verified from the remote repository; local `git status --short` clean. This is repository housekeeping, not new app runtime validation.
- **Most recent accepted interaction-design task:** three physical MX media keys plus rotary volume encoder whose **press toggles PC/Wi-Fi** (2026-10-20; design approval only, no hardware implementation).
- **Last accepted software:** Phase 5.2 device/PC artwork reliability fix on **Omarchy**; user confirmed the fix worked and ran **39 Python tests**, all passing.
- Previous accepted: Phase 4.2 Windows and Omarchy volume sync; Windows companion play/pause, album art, sound-level stream; Phase 5 pairing and simulator UI were demonstrated, then polished.
- **Do not assume:** Phase 5.2 has been individually runtime-validated on Windows after the last patch; earlier Windows platform validation is real but older.

## Implemented in current checked-in Phase 5.2 source

- Flask + Spotipy PKCE Spotify Wi-Fi mode at `/`, OAuth redirect on localhost.
- PC mode: Windows media-session adapter or Linux playerctl/MPRIS adapter; WASAPI/PipeWire audio level sampling, SSE for the glow.
- 800×480 HTML/CSS/JS interface, album-colour glow, optimistic controls, synchronized Spotify volume where the local track matches Spotify Connect; SYSTEM fallback.
- Browser `/device` simulator: four switches (previous, play/pause, next, mode switch), rotary volume steps, authenticated paired device API, state/events, album-art proxy/retry.
- Local `/pair` management page, one-time six-digit code; `--lan` optional and restricted device surface.
- `--configure` saves public Spotify client ID locally without committing it.

## Not implemented / still awaiting validation

- Actual ESP32-S3 firmware, pairing on-device, Wi-Fi provisioning, secure LAN transport, final standalone-without-PC architecture.
- Final Waveshare board SKU, connector/pinout, input expander and electrical verification, case/3-key/**push-encoder** placement. Research favors original touch SKU **25948**, but user has not selected final board. Check whether module's *full PCB* (~106.1×67.8 mm) leaves clearance behind 18 mm bottom keys and right knob.
- Real cross-platform end-to-end device simulator testing over separate physical LAN clients; Linux and Windows post-import revalidation.

## Current next action

1. **Read docs/HARDWARE-ELECTRICAL-REVIEW.md** first. Current proposed trio **Waveshare 25948 touch + Adafruit PID 377 push encoder + Waveshare AW9523B SKU 22132**, provisional **KZ0087** cosmetic knob, controls 3 MX + A/B + press (**six** contacts).
2. **Electrical verification blocker:** obtain **full viewable Waveshare AW9523B 22132 module schematic** and trace RESET pull-up, AD0/AD1 selection, I²C voltage/pullups, connector physical pin 1 and 6-pin routing. Manufacturer Wiki says RST/INT *may be left NC* on its module, but AW9523B **chip RSTN has internal 100k pull-down** and therefore requires a board-level pull-up/drive. Indexed PDF text suggests 10k resistors, **not sufficient to certify connectivity**.
3. Use external I²C **3.3V** selected at screen H8; the screen has four-wire I²C, expander six-wire PH2.0. Draft 3.3V/GND/SDA/SCL adapter and physically verify orientation and voltage before powered connection. Nominal expander address 0x58 avoids documented 0x20–0x27, 0x30–0x3F, 0x5D devices; confirm with actual I²C scan.
4. Six switches/encoder contacts on P0_0..P0_5: **proposed** 22kΩ external 3.3V pull-up at GPIO node plus 1kΩ series between node and grounded contact. Predicted LOW ~0.143V vs chip VIL max 0.4V, accidental HIGH-to-ground ~3.3mA, but **no physical electrical approval**. Software must set P0 to inputs (config 0x04), and test encoder step loss under LCD+Wi-Fi load.
5. Fit/layout blocker remains: LCD full 106.1×67.8 mm, three 18mm MX keys and 15.1mm KZ0087 knob plus push encoder must fit behind faceplate. KZ0087 depth 12.4mm maximum versus nominal 15mm encoder shaft means test visible protrusion/grub screw/push travel before case build.
6. Update prototype BOM only after safe module circuit is verified and/or residual first-prototype risks are explicitly accepted. **Do not modify accepted Phase 5.2 app until a separate implementation task.**

## Unresolved issues / deferred

- Adafruit 377 included cap rejected aesthetically; **KZ0087 provisionally selected** to match low-profile RK M75 styling. Its 12.4 mm maximum insertion is shorter than Adafruit shaft's nominal 15 mm, so mechanical fit/encoder push still require validation. Encoder electronics unchanged.
- The Waveshare AW9523B silicon **defaults GPIO to outputs**; at the anticipated 0x58 straps P0 starts low open-drain, but **RESET has internal 100k pull-down**, so verify module's external reset pull-up and boot timing. Preliminary six-input 22k pullups + 1k series are **not an approved wiring schematic**. Module full diagram still inaccessible even though an indexed text copy identifies R1–R4 10k. See `docs/HARDWARE-ELECTRICAL-REVIEW.md`.
- Part availability is variable. The Adafruit AW9523 PID 4886 module was shown sold out in one checked supplier listing; Waveshare AW9523B SKU 22132 is a proposed same-chip breakout, not necessarily plug-and-play. User has not ordered hardware.
- GPIO/I²C warning: onboard CH422G reserves `0x20–0x27` and `0x30–0x3F`, so default MCP23017 (0x20+) and Adafruit **single** I²C rotary breakout (0x36–0x3D) conflict. AW9523 (0x58) and Adafruit **QUAD** seesaw breakout (0x49) are proposed alternatives; QUAD off-label 3 MX + encoder push switch contact use needs schematic/bench checks due to possible duplicated pin listing. No purchase approval.
- The device simulator can poll `/api/device/state` repeatedly even with SSE; optimization is deferred, not a blocker.
- A test emitted a minor `ResourceWarning` about a stylesheet file handle.
- Linux `playerctl -l` previously found no player in an SSH session, yet paired device state and Spotify API worked; avoid claiming native MPRIS parity without a local player test.
- Desktop Flask server is a development prototype, not an internet-facing deployment.
- Final independent Wi-Fi mode on physical hardware still needs a design decision: do not assume Spotify embedded playback or safe on-device OAuth storage is possible.

## Workflow rules

See `docs/CHATGPT-WORKFLOW.md`. Read repository state before changes. Distinguish implemented, statically tested, runtime-tested and accepted. Preserve 800×480 UI and accepted playback behavior. Record actual ad-hoc work without inventing roadmap numbers. Commit code directly through GitHub when permitted and update this handoff after each user-accepted task. Keep passwords, OAuth tokens, pairing bearer tokens and host-specific config out of Git.
