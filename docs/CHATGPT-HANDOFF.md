# ChatGPT handoff — Spotify Desk Thing

> Current-state save point, not the full project history. **Read this first** in a new project conversation. Cross-check against the current branch and commits.

Updated: 2026-10-20

## Repository / checkpoint

- Repository: `Cousinsuke/Spotify-Desk`
- Default / current development branch: `main` (no alternate development branch established yet)
- Last source baseline: **Phase 5.2** source imported into `main` from checksum-checked ZIP; actual GitHub commit verified
- Latest implementation checkpoint: **`7172c2ee2f285253507b13c71acb7072adc04067`** (`feat: import accepted Phase 5.2 desktop and simulator baseline`, source commit). Later docs/script commits are not a newer application version.
- Handoff status: GitHub migration verified complete. All 16 historical ZIP snapshots and the checksum manifest are committed at `f78150605b15af1fa451aa5ed725f023fd03835c`; this is an archive commit, not a newer application implementation checkpoint.
- GitHub access: connected read/write access was confirmed at bootstrap; verify access in future conversations

## Current project phase vs current actual work

- **Current project phase:** Phase 6 — hardware research, compatibility decisions and first firmware design (**planned, not implemented**)
- **Current actual work:** Phase 6 physical controls **explicitly accepted** from mockup: **3 MX keys** (Prev / Play-Pause / Next) below touchscreen, and a **push-capable ~18 mm rotary encoder** on right (**turn = volume, press = PC/Wi-Fi mode**). Detached fourth MX symbol was placeholder only. Shuffle/repeat/settings through touchscreen. Input mapping accepted; electronics/CAD/firmware unvalidated.
- **Status:** Phase 5.2 software **unchanged** (GitHub checkpoint `7172c2e`), archived versions `f781506`. Waveshare/input-expander research predates 3-key preference and still includes four-key assumptions. Physical control mapping accepted and documented in `docs/DESIGN.md` / `docs/DECISIONS.md`. Needs **6 digital inputs**: 3 MX + quadrature A/B + encoder push. No hardware purchased/bench-tested or firmware changed.

## Last accepted work

- **Most recent validated repository task:** current Phase 5.2 source import and all 16 historical ZIP imports to GitHub; both commits verified from the remote repository; local `git status --short` clean. This is repository housekeeping, not new app runtime validation.
- **Most recent accepted interaction-design task:** three physical MX media keys plus rotary volume encoder whose **press toggles PC/Wi-Fi** (2026-10-20; design approval only, no hardware implementation).
- **Last accepted software:** Phase 5.2 device/PC artwork reliability fix on **Omarchy**; user confirmed the fix worked and ran **39 Python tests**, all passing.
- Previous accepted: Phase 4.2 Windows and Omarchy volume sync; Windows companion play/pause, album art, sound-level stream; Phase 5 pairing and simulator UI were demonstrated, then polished.
- **Do not assume:** Phase 5.2 has been individually runtime-validated on Windows after the last patch; earlier Windows platform validation is real but older.

## Implemented in current checked-in Phase 5.2 source

- Flask + Spotipy PKCE Spotify Wi-Fi mode at `/`, OAuth redirect on localhost.
- PC mode: Windows media-session adapter or Linux playerctl/MPRIS adapter; WASAPI/PipeWire audio level sampling, SSE for the glow.
- 800×480 HTML/CSS/JS interface, album-colour glow, optimistic controls, synchronized Spotify volume where the local track matches Spotify Connect; SYSTEM fallback.
- Browser `/device` simulator: four switches (previous, play/pause, next, mode switch), rotary volume steps, authenticated paired device API, state/events, album-art proxy/retry.
- Local `/pair` management page, one-time six-digit code; `--lan` optional and restricted device surface.
- `--configure` saves public Spotify client ID locally without committing it.

## Not implemented / still awaiting validation

- Actual ESP32-S3 firmware, pairing on-device, Wi-Fi provisioning, secure LAN transport, final standalone-without-PC architecture.
- Final Waveshare board SKU, connector/pinout, input expander and electrical verification, case/3-key/**push-encoder** placement. Research favors original touch SKU **25948**, but user has not selected final board. Check whether module's *full PCB* (~106.1×67.8 mm) leaves clearance behind 18 mm bottom keys and right knob.
- Real cross-platform end-to-end device simulator testing over separate physical LAN clients; Linux and Windows post-import revalidation.

## Current next action

1. **Do not reopen agreed control choice:** 3 MX keys (previous/play-pause/next), encoder turn for volume and integrated momentary press for **PC/Wi-Fi mode**. The detached fourth MX icon was explicitly a discarded placeholder. User provided approx. 18 mm MX keycaps and 18 mm knob diameter.
2. Source/check **push-capable encoder** options (detents, quadrature resolution, switch travel, shaft and 18 mm knob fit), faceplate spacing and Waveshare board internal depth.
3. Research **six digital input signals** and compatible 3.3 V I²C connection: AW9523 (0x58), TCA9539 (0x74–0x77) or QUAD seesaw breakout (0x49). For QUAD, hypothesize 3 MX + encoder push on four switch contacts and one A/B encoder, **not bench-proven**; published pin conflict needs schematic verification.
4. Reassess Waveshare 25948 versus brighter B board; no procurement, validated electrical schematic or firmware selection yet.
5. Separate future code task: adapt accepted Phase 5.2 four-key simulator to **three keys + encoder push** while preserving playback controls and pairing; do **not** silently alter working application.
6. Keep Windows/Omarchy Phase 5.2 post-import runtime verification and LAN/security work separate.

## Recent meaningful commits

- `7172c2e` — accepted Phase 5.2 source imported into `main` (**implementation checkpoint**).
- `234a976` — sanitize generated Python bytecode when preserving old ZIPs.
- `f781506` — all 16 historical ZIP archives and checksum manifest pushed and verified.
- `196a66a` — Phase 6 WaveShare board/expander manufacturer-source research (documentation only; no application or firmware changed).
- `5833f0e` — Phase 6 extended screen/input-expander comparison; includes AW9523 and QUAD seesaw ideas (documentation only).
- 2026-10-20 user-accepted physical design mapping: **3 MX keys + push encoder (turn volume, push PC/Wi-Fi)**; docs-only. No fourth physical MX key.
- Documentation-only commits after this checkpoint are not evidence of newer runtime implementation.

## Unresolved issues / deferred

- GPIO/I²C warning: onboard CH422G reserves `0x20–0x27` and `0x30–0x3F`, so default MCP23017 (0x20+) and Adafruit **single** I²C rotary breakout (0x36–0x3D) conflict. AW9523 (0x58) and Adafruit **QUAD** seesaw breakout (0x49) are proposed alternatives; QUAD off-label 3 MX + encoder push switch contact use needs schematic/bench checks due to possible duplicated pin listing. No purchase approval.
- The device simulator can poll `/api/device/state` repeatedly even with SSE; optimization is deferred, not a blocker.
- A test emitted a minor `ResourceWarning` about a stylesheet file handle.
- Linux `playerctl -l` previously found no player in an SSH session, yet paired device state and Spotify API worked; avoid claiming native MPRIS parity without a local player test.
- Desktop Flask server is a development prototype, not an internet-facing deployment.
- Final independent Wi-Fi mode on physical hardware still needs a design decision: do not assume Spotify embedded playback or safe on-device OAuth storage is possible.

## Workflow rules

See `docs/CHATGPT-WORKFLOW.md`. Read repository state before changes. Distinguish implemented, statically tested, runtime-tested and accepted. Preserve 800×480 UI and accepted playback behavior. Record actual ad-hoc work without inventing roadmap numbers. Commit code directly through GitHub when permitted and update this handoff after each user-accepted task. Keep passwords, OAuth tokens, pairing bearer tokens and host-specific config out of Git.
